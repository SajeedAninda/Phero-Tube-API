                    Scope of <strong>Var</strong>, <strong>Let</strong>, and <strong>Const</strong> in JavaScript
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content text-lg">
                    <p>The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed in JavaScript code. There are
                        three types of scope in JavaScript:

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Global scope:</strong> Variables declared outside of any function are globally
                            scoped. They can be
                            accessed from anywhere in the code.</li>
                        <li><strong>Function scope:</strong> Variables declared inside a function are function scoped.
                            They can only be
                            accessed from within that function.</li>
                        <li><strong>Block scope:</strong> Variables declared inside a block of code (such as a for loop
                            or if statement)
                            are
                            block scoped. They can only be accessed from within that block of code.</li> <br>
                    </ol>
                    The keywords var, let, and const all create variables, but they have different scoping rules.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Var variables:</strong> Var variables are function scoped. This means that they can
                            be accessed from
                            anywhere within the function where they are declared, and from any nested functions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Let variables:</strong> Let variables are block scoped. This means that they can
                            only be accessed
                            from
                            within the block of code where they are declared.</li>
                        <li><strong>Const variables:</strong> Const variables are also block scoped, but they cannot be
                            re-assigned once
                            they
                            are declared.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="collapse collapse-plus bg w-full h-fit mb-6 shadow-lg">
                <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-3" checked="checked" />

                    Use Cases of <strong>Null</strong> and <strong>Defined</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content text-lg">
                    <p>
                        Some scenarios where null and undefined are utilized in JavaScript are listed below:

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            1. <strong>Representing a empty value:</strong> null can be employed to signify a value,
                            such, as a missing
                            or unset
                            value. For instance you can use null to symbolize the absence of a value in a variable that
                            hasn't been assigned yet.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            2. <strong>Representing a unknown value:</strong> undefined is used to represent a value
                            like a deleted or
                            non existent
                            value. As an example you can use undefined to denote the state of a variable that has been
                            declared but not yet assigned any value.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            3. <strong>Controlling code execution:</strong> Both null and undefined can be used to
                            direct the flow of
                            execution in your JavaScript code. For instance you may utilize null to check if a variable
                            has
                            been assigned a value or you can employ undefined to verify if a variable has been declared.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            4. <strong>Controlling code execution:</strong> Leveraging null and undefined can contribute
                            to
                            readability and maintainability of your JavaScript code. For example of using phrases, like
                            "empty " employing null to represent a value would make your code more readable and easier
                            for
                            others to understand.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="collapse collapse-plus bg w-full h-fit mb-6 shadow-lg">
                <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-3" checked="checked" />

                    What is meant by <strong>REST API</strong>?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content text-lg">
                    <p>
                        <strong>REST API</strong> stands for <strong>Representational State Transfer Application
                            Programming Interface</strong>. It is an
                        architectural style for designing web services. REST APIs are based on the HTTP protocol and use
                        standard HTTP methods to access resources.

                        The four main HTTP methods used in REST APIs are: <br>

                        <strong>GET:</strong> Used to retrieve a resource. <br>
                        <strong>POST:</strong> Used to create a new resource. <br>
                        <strong>PUT:</strong> Used to update an existing resource. <br>
                        <strong>DELETE:</strong> Used to delete a resource. <br>
                        REST APIs are often used to exchange data between different applications. For example, a REST
                        API could be used to allow a mobile app to access data from a web server.
