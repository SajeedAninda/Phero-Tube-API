                    Discuss the scope of <strong>Var</strong>, <strong>Let</strong>, and <strong>Const</strong>

                <div class="collapse-content text-lg">
                    <p><strong>Var, Let and Const</strong> all are variable and the scope of a variable means where it
                        can be accessed. There are three types of Scopes in Javascript: <br>
                        <strong>Global Scope:</strong> Variables that are defined outside any functions of blocks are
                        global scoped. They can be accessed from anywhere in the code. <br>
                        <strong>Function Scope:</strong> This refers to variables that are declared inside a function.
                        They can be only accessed from that function. <br>
                        <strong>Block Scope:</strong> This means the variables that are declared inside a block of code,
                        inside curly braces, like inside a loop or if-else statement. They can be only used inside that
                        block. <br>

                        While Var, Let and Const all create variable, they have different scopes. Let and Const are
                        block scoped while var is global or function scoped.

                    <p>
                        Some examples of how <strong>Null</strong> and <strong>Undefined</strong> are used in JavaScript
                        are given below: <br>
                        <strong>1. Representing an empty value:</strong> Null can be used to represent a missing or
                        unset value. For
                        example, it can be used to express a lack of value in a variable that hasn't been assigned a
                        value yet. <br>
                        <strong>2. Representing an unknown value:</strong> Undefined can be used to represent a value
                        that to denote the
                        state of a variable that has been already declared but the value hasn't been assigned. <br>
                        <strong>3. Controlling code execution:</strong> Null and undefined variables can be used in
                        JavaScript code
                        control execution flow, indicating assigned values or declared variables. <br>
                        <strong>4. Code Understanding:</strong> Null and undefined JavaScript representations enhance
                        readability and maintainability, making code easier to read and understand.

                    What do you mean by <strong>REST API</strong>?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content text-lg">
                    The full form of <strong>REST API</strong> is <strong>Representational State Transfer Application
                        Programming Interface</strong>. REST
                    APIs are built on the HTTP protocol and access resources using conventional HTTP methods. The four
                    primary HTTP methods used in REST APIs are as follows: <br>
                    <strong>GET:</strong> It is Used to retrieve Data. <br>
                    <strong>POST:</strong> It is used to create new resource or data. <br>
                    <strong>PUT:</strong> Used for updating an existing resource. <br>
                    <strong>DELETE:</strong> This is used to delete a resource. <br>
                    REST APIs are frequently used to transmit data between apps. A REST API, for example, may be used to
                    allow a website to retrieve data from a web server.
